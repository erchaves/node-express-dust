# XXX-TODO-XXX Project

## About the project
todo...


## Development Setup

Install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
Copy a local .env file:
You must rename or copy the `readme.env` to `.env`.
`.env` should be .gitignore'd and not pushed.
Follow the comments in that file to replace default values as needed.

Running locally:
```bash
npm run dev
# or just run 'gulp' if you have it installed globally.
# The app will be served at `localhost:3000`
```

## Production Setup
Running on Prod:
```bash
npm start
# npm prestart will run the gulp build before it starts the server
```
